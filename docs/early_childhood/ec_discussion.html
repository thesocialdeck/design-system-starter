								  <p>The purpose of this discussion paper is to support the Australian Government’s consultations regarding early childhood education and care for the 2020 Review (Review) of the <em>Disability Standards for Education 2005</em> (the Standards). This follows the first <a href='https://disabilitystandardsreview.education.gov.au/discussion_paper/'>discussion paper</a>, published on 16 July 2020, which set out the role of the Standards and the purpose and scope of the Review.</p>
								  <p>In this paper we set out how the <a href='https://www.legislation.gov.au/Details/C2018C00125'><em>Disability Discrimination Act 1992 (DDA)</em></a> and the Standards apply to early childhood education and care. We explain what previous reviews told us about early childhood education and care and the Standards, what we want to learn about in this Review, and how you can get involved. This paper also includes discussion questions to help us learn about your views and experiences.</p>
								  <p>There is strong evidence that the <strong>early years of a child’s life have a profound impact on their future cognitive, social, emotional and physical development</strong>. The skills and abilities acquired in early childhood are fundamental to a person’s success and wellbeing later in life.</p>
								  <p>Early childhood education and care provides the foundation for children to learn and develop in a safe environment while also having the opportunity to socialise with other children. In addition to benefiting the child&#39;s development, early childhood education and care also supports working families to return to work. </p>
								  <p>In the December quarter of 2019, 1.3 million children from over 900,000 families attended early childhood education and care services (see <a href='https://www.education.gov.au/child-care-australia-report-december-quarter-2019' target='_blank' class='url'>https://www.education.gov.au/child-care-australia-report-december-quarter-2019</a>). In 2018, the Australian Bureau of Statistics’ Survey of Disability, Ageing and Carers (SDAC) reported <strong>4 per cent of 0‑4 year old children as having a disability</strong>.</p>
								  
								  <p><h2 class="au-inpage-nav-section au-display-XL"><em>Disability Discrimination Act 1992</em> and early childhood education and care<a id="section2" class="au-inpage-nav-section-link" href="#top">Back to top</a></h2></p>
								  <p>The <strong>DDA</strong> <strong>is Commonwealth legislation that has been in place for nearly three decades</strong>. </p>
								  <p>Under the DDA, it is <strong>unlawful to discriminate against a person on the basis of disability</strong>. The DDA protects people with disability against discrimination in a range of areas of public life, including education. </p>
								  <p><strong>All early childhood education and care services must comply with the DDA.</strong></p>
								  <p>This is because <strong>section 22 of the DDA</strong> makes it unlawful for an educational authority to refuse or fail to accept a person’s application for admission, or to make certain terms or conditions on the admission, that discriminate against the person on the grounds of their disability. It is also unlawful for an education provider to discriminate against a person on the basis of their disability, including having curriculum content that excludes the person from participating.</p>
								  <p>If an early childhood education and care provider is not considered to be an education authority or education provider, as defined in the DDA, they need to meet <strong>section 24 of the DDA</strong>, which makes it unlawful for them as a provider of goods, services or facilities to refuse to provide those goods, services or facilities to someone because of their disability. This includes the terms and conditions which outline how relevant goods or services will be made available to others.</p>
								  <p>Under the DDA, an early childhood education and care <strong>provider must make reasonable adjustments</strong> to accommodate a person with disability, unless making the adjustment would impose an unjustifiable hardship on the provider.</p>
								  
								  <h2 class="au-inpage-nav-section au-display-XL"><strong><em>Disability Standards for Education 2005</em> and early childhood education and care <a id="section3" class="au-inpage-nav-section-link" href="#top"></a>Back to top</strong> </h2>
								  <p>The Standards came into effect on 18 August 2005. They seek to ensure that students with disability can <strong>access and participate in education on the same basis as students without disability</strong>. </p>
									<p>The Standards are subordinate legislation to the DDA; this means they sit under the DDA. The purpose of the Standards is to clarify the obligations of education and training providers, and the rights of students with disability and their families under the DDA. They are intended to <strong>make it easier to understand rights and obligations</strong> under the DDA.</p>
									<p>The Standards set out the <strong>rights of students with disability</strong> and the <strong>obligations of education providers</strong> regarding: </p>
									<ul>
									<li><p>enrolment</p></li>
									<li><p>participation</p></li>
									<li><p>curriculum development, accreditation and delivery</p></li>
									<li><p>student support services, and </p></li>
									<li><p>elimination of harassment and victimisation. </p></li>

									</ul>
									<p>In an early childhood education and care context, the <strong>Standards apply to “preschools, including kindergartens (but not child-care providers)”</strong> (see <em>Disability Standards for Education 2005</em> at <a href='https://www.legislation.gov.au/Details/F2005L00767' target='_blank' class='url'>https://www.legislation.gov.au/Details/F2005L00767</a>).</p>
									<p>This means preschools (including kindergartens) and the children and families using their services have their rights and obligations under the DDA clarified by the Standards. Child care providers and families using their services rely on any precedents that may be set through individual court case outcomes to guide their interpretation of rights and obligations under the DDA.</p>
									<p>The Standards were previously reviewed in 2010 and 2015. Both the <strong>2010 and 2015 Reviews recommended considering extending the application of the Standards to child care providers</strong>. The 2015 Review found that the sector had undergone significant reforms which increasingly emphasised the educational purpose of early childhood education and care services, and noted the exclusion of child care from the Standards appeared to be an anomaly. </p>
									<p>Previous reviews also found the distinction made in the Standards between preschools / kindergartens and child care providers does not reflect the complex arrangements in place in the early childhood education and care sector. </p>
									<ul>
									<li><p>There are a <strong>diverse range of service types</strong> <strong>offered by early childhood education and care providers.</strong> These include preschools, kindergartens, centre based day care, family day care, in home care, outside school hours care (including for school aged children), and a range of other services. </p></li>
									<li><p><strong>Early education and care learning programs, including preschool programs, are delivered across these different settings in different ways</strong> (e.g. a centre based day care service may offer a preschool program).</p></li>

								  <p>As part of the Review of the Standards, we are examining the <strong>extent to which families, educators and early childhood education and care providers know about, understand and comply with their existing rights and responsibilities under the DDA</strong>.</p>
								  <p>We will use this information to help us determine what may be required to:</p>
								  <ul>
								  <li><p>help parents and carers understand the rights of their child with disability </p></li>
								  <li><p>give child care providers greater certainty and clarity about their obligations regarding children with disability</p></li>
								  <li><p>support children with disability to access education in an early childhood education and care setting on the same basis as children without disabilities.</p></li>

								  <p>The Australian Children’s Education and Care Quality Authority (ACECQA) is the national authority that assists all governments in administering the National Quality Framework for early childhood education and care services. ACECQA will conduct consultations with early childhood education and care providers to inform the Review.</p>
								<p>ACECQA’s provider consultations will explore many of the issues in this discussion paper, and seek provider views on other opportunities to support access and participation of children with disability in early childhood education and care and school-aged education and care. </p>
								<p>ACECQA will contact providers about the direct consultation process. For more information, please go to the <a href='https://www.acecqa.gov.au/have-your-say-DDA'>ACECQA website</a>.</p>

								   <p>To help ensure people with disability are able to engage with the Review and share their insights and experiences, consultations will be accessible. This includes access to Easy Read documents, Auslan-English interpreters and captioning. Easy Read and other materials will be made available in advance to help people consider the information being provided and the questions being asked. The Review will consider people’s preferences about how they want to share their experience. People can choose how they want to engage, including answering questions in their own time online or joining a discussion. We will do our best to ensure opportunities, including the length and time of consultations, accommodate people’s specific needs and requests.</p>
								  <h2 class="au-inpage-nav-section au-display-XL">Public consultations will inform our advice to governments<a id="section9" class="au-inpage-nav-section-link" href="#top">Back to top</a></h2>
								  <p>Your input to the Review will provide insights into how well services and families understand their rights and obligations under the DDA in relation to education and learning delivered within an early childhood education and care setting. If we find that the current arrangements are not working well, we will make recommendations on what needs to change, how to change it, and in what timeframe changes should be implemented. </p>
									<p>We will do this in partnership with state and territory governments, who we will work with closely and collaboratively to develop the final report and associated report recommendations. Our intention is to focus on opportunities for national collaborative action between the Australian Government, states and territories, and government and non-government education providers. </p>
									<p>The Review report will be provided to the Federal Minister for Education in December 2020. The final report will be presented to all governments for their consideration in early 2021.</p>
